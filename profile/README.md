# Welcome to Centrum IntelliPhysics Group at Johns Hopkins University

Our group is an interdisciplinary research group pioneering the convergence of **physics-based modeling** and **scientific machine learning** to solve complex scientific and engineering challenges.
“We don’t replace physics — we **augment** it with intelligent data-driven models.”

## 🚀 Research Themes

Our lab is driven by the vision of **redefining scientific discovery** by blending **first-principles physics** with **data-driven intelligence**. Our core research thrusts include:
- 🔁 **Hybrid Physics-AI Solvers**:  
  Coupling neural operators (e.g., DeepONet) with finite element methods for complex dynamics and multiscale modeling.
- 🧩 **Latent Representations for Physical Systems**:  
  Developing latent neural operators to learn low-dimensional, physics-consistent embeddings for design and control.
- 🧮 **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**:  
  Leveraging PINNs, operator learning, and physics-informed generative models to accelerate discovery.
