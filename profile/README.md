# Welcome to Centrum IntelliPhysics Group at Johns Hopkins University
 Like all good models, this page is iteratively updated. :)

We are an interdisciplinary research collective pioneering the convergence of **physics-based modeling** and **scientific machine learning** to tackle complex scientific and engineering challenges. “We don’t replace physics — we **augment** it with intelligent data-driven models.”

## Research Themes

Our lab is driven by the vision of **redefining scientific discovery** by blending **first-principles physics** with **data-driven intelligence**. Our core research thrusts include:
- **Hybrid Physics-AI Solvers**:  
  Coupling neural operators with finite element methods to accelerate the time-to-solution as well as long rollouts for complex dynamics and multiscale modelin
- **Latent Representations for Physical Systems**:  
  Developing latent neural operators to learn low-dimensional, physics-consistent embeddings for design and control.
- **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**:  
  Leveraging PINNs and physics-informed operator learning to accelerate discovery.
- **Mechanics Datasets**:  
  Compiling a collection of open-access mechanics datasets to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Each dataset is generated using the open-source finite element software FEniCS and released under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. You are welcome to download and use them for any research or educational purpose!
