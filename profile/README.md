# Welcome to Centrum IntelliPhysics Group at Johns Hopkins University
 Like all good models, this page is iteratively updated. :)

We are an interdisciplinary research collective pioneering the convergence of **physics-based modeling** and **scientific machine learning** to tackle complex scientific and engineering challenges. “We don’t replace physics — we **augment** it with intelligent data-driven models.”

## 🚀 Research Themes

Our lab is driven by the vision of **redefining scientific discovery** by blending **first-principles physics** with **data-driven intelligence**. Our core research thrusts include:
- 🔁 **Hybrid Physics-AI Solvers**:  
  Coupling neural operators with finite element methods to accelerate the time-to-solution as well as long rollouts for complex dynamics and multiscale modelin
- 🧩 **Latent Representations for Physical Systems**:  
  Developing latent neural operators to learn low-dimensional, physics-consistent embeddings for design and control.
- 🧮 **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**:  
  Leveraging PINNs and physics-informed operator learning to accelerate discovery.
- 🧮 **Phase Field Datasets**:  
  Curating multiple open access phase field based mechanics datasets for assessing the performance of machine learning models. All datasets are created with open source finite element software FEniCS, and all are shared under CC BY SA 4.0 licenses. Please feel free to download and use them for any research or educational purposes!
